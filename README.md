1. Launch an EC2 Instance: EC2 is a virtual server in the cloud. Launch an EC2 instance with an appropriate operating system (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu) and choose the instance type based on your requirements.

2. Configure Security Groups: Security groups control the inbound and outbound traffic to your EC2 instance. Make sure to open the necessary ports for your Angular frontend, Python backend, and PostgreSQL database.

3. Install Dependencies: Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH and install the necessary dependencies such as Node.js, Python, and PostgreSQL.

4. Set Up the Frontend: Clone your Angular frontend repository to the EC2 instance and follow the installation instructions to build and deploy the frontend.

5. Set Up the Backend: Clone your Python backend repository to the EC2 instance and install the required dependencies using a virtual environment (e.g., virtualenv). Configure any necessary environment variables, such as database connection details.

6. Set Up the Database: Install PostgreSQL on your EC2 instance and create a new database for your application. Set up the necessary tables and schema.

7. Configure Reverse Proxy: Use a web server like Nginx or Apache to configure a reverse proxy to redirect requests from the frontend to the backend.

8. Connect Backend to PostgreSQL: Update your backend code to connect to the PostgreSQL database using appropriate credentials and connection details.

9. Start Services: Start your backend Python application using a process manager like Supervisor or systemd. Configure it to start automatically on system boot. Similarly, start the web server to handle frontend requests.

10. Test and Verify: Access your Angular frontend through the public IP or domain of your EC2 instance. Test the frontend-to-backend communication and ensure the expected behavior.

Note: For production environments, additional steps such as domain registration, SSL certificate configuration, and scaling considerations should be taken into account.
